# 👋 Hi there!

I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science, with a growing interest in how data can drive smarter business decisions. My background includes experience with programming, databases, and real-world software development through an internship as a back-end Java developer.

While I'm still early in my graduate studies, I'm continually building my skills and exploring the tools of the trade—from data wrangling and statistics to deep learning and beyond.
